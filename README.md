# HTTP_get_implementation

The purpose of this project was to gain knowledge of how internet protocols work, specifically HTTP. The server is made to handle get and conditional get responses that are sent from the server. The client caches files received from the server. The cache is implemented through a .txt file.

The server also works with a web browser.
